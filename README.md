# Getting Started
___

Make sure you have [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed in order to run my gulpfile. The gulpfile transpiles from ES6 to ES5 to run in all browsers. 

> ### 1. Clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bbcharlton/Chess-Project.git
```

This creates a local copy of my project.

> ### 2. Install dev dependencies.

```shell
npm install --only=dev
```

This loads in all the development dependencies used in my gulpfile.

> ### 3. Run Gulp task.

```shell
gulp
```

Just a simple Gulp command to run that will transpile the ES6 code, uglify the JavaScript, and minify the CSS. This sets up all the files we'll need to run the project properly with full optimization.

> ### 4. Open index.html

The Chess Project index.html page should now load in the browser and is ready to be used.

# Final Notes

I actually had a lot of fun with this project. I really learned a lot, mostly about ES6 and using Gulp for development. These two things are what took me the most time because I was simply learning rather than doing. But it turned out great. I thought I'd do my best and go all out to optimize the site, design it, and have it meet every requirement. Not going to lie, I did reference a good amount of Stack Overflow and the MDN docs. I'm still kind of a beginner, but there's so much more for me to learn and work with, and I'm excited to do so.
